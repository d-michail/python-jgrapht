def greedy_max_cardinality(graph, sort=False):
    r"""The greedy algorithm for maximum cardinality matching in arbitrary graphs. 

    The algorithm can run in two modes: sorted or unsorted. When unsorted, the matching
    is obtained by iterating through the edges and adding an edge if it doesn't conflict
    with the edges already in the matching. When sorted, the edges are first sorted by
    the sum of degrees of their endpoints. After that, the algorithm proceeds in the same
    manner. Running this algorithm in sorted mode can sometimes produce better results,
    albeit at the cost of some additional computational overhead.

    Independent of the mode, the resulting matching is maximal, and is therefore guaranteed
    to contain at least half of the edges that a maximum cardinality matching has
    (1/2 approximation). The algorithm runs in :math:`\mathcal{O}(m)` time when the edges 
    are not sorted and in :math:`\mathcal{O}(m + m \log n)` time when sorted where
    :math:`n` is the number of vertices and :math:`m` the number of edges of the graph.

def edmonds_max_cardinality(graph, dense=False):
    r"""Edmonds blossom algorithm for maximum cardinality matching in general undirected graphs.

    A matching in a graph :math:`G(V,E)` is a subset of edges :math:`M` such that no two edges
    in :math:`M` have a vertex in common. A matching has at most :math:`\frac{1}{2}|V|` edges.
    A node :math:`v` in :math:`G` is matched by matching :math:`M` if :math:`M` contains an edge
    incident to :math:`v`. A matching is perfect if all nodes are matched. By definition, a perfect
    matching consists of exactly :math:`\frac{1}{2}|V|` edges. This algorithm will return a
    perfect matching if one exists. If no perfect matching exists, then the largest (non-perfect)
    matching is returned instead. In the special case that the input graph is bipartite, consider
    using :py:meth:`.bipartite_max_cardinality()` instead.

    To compute a maximum cardinality matching, at most :math:`n` augmenting path computations are
    performed. Each augmenting path computation takes :math:`\mathcal{O}(m \alpha(m,n))` time,
    where :math:`\alpha(m,n)` is the inverse of the Ackerman function, :math:`n` is the number of
    vertices, and :math:`m` the number of edges. This results in a total runtime complexity of
    :math:`\mathcal{O}(n m \alpha (m,n))`. In practice, the number of augmenting path computations
    performed is far smaller than :math:`n`, since an efficient heuristic (greedy maximum cardinality 
    matching algorithm)  is used to compute a near-optimal initial solution.

    The runtime complexity of this implementation could be improved to :math:`\mathcal{O}(nm)` when
    the UnionFind data structure used in this implementation is replaced by the linear-time set union
    data structure proposed in: Gabow, H.N., Tarjan, R.E. A linear-time algorithm for a special
    case of disjoint set union. Proc. Fifteenth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1982,
    pp. 246-251.

    Edmonds' original algorithm first appeared in Edmonds, J. Paths, trees, and flowers. Canadian
    Journal of Mathematics 17, 1965, pp. 449-467, and had a runtime complexity of
    :math:`\mathcal{O}(n^4)`.

    This method utilizes two different implementation depending on whether the user adjusts the input
    parameter `dense`:

      * If `dense` is true then this implementation follows more closely the description provided in
        Tarjan, R.E. Data Structures and Network Algorithms. Society for Industrial and Applied
        Mathematics, 1983, chapter 9. In addition, the following sources were used for the
        implementation:

def greedy_max_weight(graph, normalize_edge_costs=False, tolerance=1e-9):
    r"""The greedy algorithm for computing a maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph.

    The algorithm runs in :math:`\mathcal{O}(m+m \log n)` where :math:`n` is the number of
    vertices and :math:`m` is the number of edges of the graph. This implementation accepts
    directed and undirected graphs which may contain self-loops and multiple (parallel) edges.
    There is no assumption on the edge weights, i.e. they can also be negative or zero.

    This algorithm can be run in two modes: with and without edge cost normalization. Without
    normalization, the algorithm first orders the edge set in non-increasing order of weights
    and then greedily constructs a maximal cardinality matching out of the edges with positive
    weight. A maximal cardinality matching (not to be confused with maximum cardinality) is a
    matching that cannot be increased in cardinality without removing an edge first. The
    resulting matching is guaranteed to be a 1/2-approximation.

    With normalization, the edges are sorted in non-increasing order of their normalized costs
    :math:`\frac{c(u,v)}{d(u)+d(v)}` instead, after which the algorithm proceeds in the same
    manner. Here, :math:`c(u,v)` is the cost of edge :math:`(u,v)`, and :math:`d(u)` resp
    :math:`d(v)` are the degrees of vertices :math:`u` resp :math:`v`. Running this algorithm
    in normalized mode often (but not always!) produces a better result than running the algorithm
    without normalization. Note however that the normalized version does NOT produce a
    1/2-approximation. See `this proof <https://mathoverflow.net/questions/269526/is-greedy-matching-algorithm-with-normalized-edge-weights-a-2-approximation/269760#269760>`_ for
    details. The runtime complexity remains the same, independent of whether normalization is used.

def pathgrowing_max_weight(graph):

    A linear time 1/2 approximation algorithm for finding a maximum weight matching in an
    arbitrary graph. Linear time here means :math:`\mathcal{O}(m)` where :math:`m` is the
    cardinality of the edge set, even if the graph contains isolated vertices. 1/2-approximation
    means that for any graph instance, the algorithm computes a matching whose weight is at least
    half of the weight of a maximum weight matching. The implementation accepts directed and
    undirected graphs which may contain self-loops and multiple edges. There is no assumption on

    The Hopcroft-Karp matching algorithm computes augmenting paths of increasing length, until
    no augmenting path exists in the graph. At each iteration, the algorithm runs a Breadth-First
    Search from the exposed (free) vertices, until an augmenting path is found. Next, a Depth-First
    Search is performed to find all (vertex disjoint) augmenting paths of the same length.
    The matching is augmented along all discovered augmenting paths simultaneously.
