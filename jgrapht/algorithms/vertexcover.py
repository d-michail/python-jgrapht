    At each iteration the algorithm picks the vertex :math:`v` with 
    the minimum ratio of weight over degree. Afterwards it removes all 
    its incident edges and recurses.

    Its running time is :math:`\mathcal{O}(m \log n)`. The implementation
    supports both the uniform and the weighted case where the graph vertices
    have weights.
