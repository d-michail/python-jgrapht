    Computes the closeness centrality of each vertex of a graph. The closeness

    This implementation computes by default the closeness centrality using outgoing paths and
    normalizes the scores. This behavior can be adjusted by the arguments.
 
    When the graph is disconnected, the closeness centrality score equals :math:`0` for all
    vertices. In the case of weakly connected digraphs, the closeness centrality of several
    vertices might be :math:`0`. See :py:meth:`~jgrapht.algorithms.scoring.harmonic_centrality`

    This is a simple iterative implementation of PageRank which stops after a given number of
    iterations or if the PageRank values between two iterations do not change more than a predefined
    value. The implementation uses the variant which divides by the number of nodes, thus forming a
    probability distribution over graph nodes.

    the number of nodes and :math:`m` the number of edges of the graph. The maximum number of
    iterations can be adjusted by the caller.
 
    If the graph is a weighted graph, a weighted variant is used where the probability of following

def coreness(graph):

    A :math:`k`-core of a graph :math:`G` is a maximal connected subgraph of :math:`G` in
    which all vertices have degree at least :math:`k`. Equivalently, it is one of the
    connected components of the subgraph of :math:`G` formed by repeatedly deleting all
    vertices of degree less than :math:`k`. A vertex :math:`u` has coreness :math:`c` if it
    belongs to a :math:`c`-core but not to any :math:`(c+1)`-core.

    If a non-empty :math:`k`-core exists, then, clearly, :math:`G` has
    `degeneracy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)>`_ at least :math:`k`,
