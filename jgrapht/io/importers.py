    The importer reads the input into a graph which is provided by the user. In case the graph is weighted and the corresponding edge
    attribute "weight" is defined, the importer also reads edge weights. Otherwise edge weights are ignored. The provided graph object,
    where the imported graph will be stored, must be able to support the features of the graph that is read. For example if the GEXF
    file contains self-loops then the graph provided must also support self-loops. The same for multiple edges. Moreover, the parser
    completely ignores the global attribute "defaultedgetype" and the edge attribute "type" which denotes whether an edge is directed
    or not. Whether edges are directed or not depends on the underlying implementation of the user provided graph object.

    The importer by default validates the input using the 1.2draft GEXF Schema. The user can (not recommended) disable the validation
    by adjusting the appropriate parameter. Older schemas are not supported.

    The graph vertices and edges are build automatically by the graph. The id of the vertices in the input file are reported as a
    vertex attribute named "ID". The user can also bypass vertex creation by providing a import identifier callback. This callback 
    accepts as a parameter the vertex identifier read from file and should return the new vertex.

    .. note:: The import identifier callback accepts a single parameter which is the identifier read
              from the input file as a string. For default graphs it should return an integer for the 
              graph vertex. For any-hashable graphs is may return any hashable object which will serve
              as the graph vertex.

    .. note:: Attribute callback functions accept three parameters. The first is the integer vertex
              or edge identifier. The second is the attribute key and the third is the 
              attribute value. They are only used for default graphs. any-hashable graphs get the

    The importer reads the input into a graph which is provided by the user. In case the graph
    is weighted and the corresponding edge attribute "weight" is defined, the importer also
    reads edge weights. Otherwise edge weights are ignored. The provided graph object, where the
    imported graph will be stored, must be able to support the features of the graph that is read.
    For example if the GraphML file contains self-loops then the graph provided must also support
    self-loops. The same for multiple edges. Moreover, the parser  completely ignores the global
    attribute "edgedefault" which denotes whether an edge is directed or not. Whether edges are
    directed or not depends on the underlying implementation of the user provided graph object.

    The importer by default validates the input using 1.0 
    `GraphML Schema <http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd>`_.
    The user can (not recommended) disable the validation
    by adjusting the appropriate parameter.

    The graph vertices and edges are build automatically by the graph. The id of the vertices in the
    input file are reported as a vertex attribute named "ID". The user can also bypass vertex creation
    by providing a import identifier callback. This callback accepts as a parameter the vertex
    identifier read from file and should return the new vertex.

    .. note:: The import identifier callback accepts a single parameter which is the identifier read
              from the input file as a string. For default graphs it should return an integer for the 
              graph vertex. For any-hashable graphs is may return any hashable object which will serve
              as the graph vertex.

    .. note:: Attribute callback functions accept three parameters. The first is the integer vertex
              or edge identifier. The second is the attribute key and the third is the 
              attribute value. They are only used for default graphs. any-hashable graphs get the
              attributes/properties automatically loaded.

    .. note:: The parameter simple affect the capabilities of the importer. It trades functionality
              for parsing speed.
